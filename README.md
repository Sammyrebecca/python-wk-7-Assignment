Iris Dataset Analysis Project
Overview
This project demonstrates comprehensive data analysis and visualization techniques using the famous Iris dataset. The implementation includes data loading, exploration, statistical analysis, and multiple visualizations to uncover patterns and relationships within the dataset.

Features
Data Loading & Cleaning: Loads the Iris dataset and handles missing values

Statistical Analysis: Computes descriptive statistics and group-based aggregations

Data Visualization: Creates four required visualizations plus additional insightful plots

Error Handling: Includes robust exception handling for data loading and processing

Professional Reporting: Clear section organization with detailed findings

Requirements
Python 3.6+

pandas

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

numpy

Installation
Clone or download this project

Install required packages:

bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn numpy
Usage
Run the Python script directly:

bash
python iris_analysis.py
Or use in a Jupyter notebook by copying the code cells.

Project Structure
The code is organized into three main tasks:

Task 1: Data Loading and Exploration
Loads the Iris dataset from scikit-learn

Displays dataset structure and information

Checks for and handles missing values

Provides basic dataset information

Task 2: Basic Data Analysis
Computes descriptive statistics for numerical columns

Performs grouping operations by species

Identifies patterns and relationships in the data

Task 3: Data Visualization
Creates four required visualizations:

Line chart showing measurement trends

Bar chart comparing averages across species

Histogram displaying distribution of sepal length

Scatter plot showing relationship between sepal and petal length

Plus additional visualizations:

Box plots for measurement distributions by species

Correlation heatmap of all numerical features

Key Findings
The dataset contains 150 samples with no missing values

Balanced distribution with 50 samples for each species

Setosa has distinct characteristics with smaller petals

Strong correlation between petal length and petal width

Clear separation between species in measurement patterns

Customization
This code can be easily adapted for other datasets by:

Replacing the data loading section with your dataset

Adjusting column names and variables accordingly

Modifying visualization parameters as needed

Output
The script generates:

Console output with statistical results and findings

Multiple matplotlib visualizations in separate windows

Comprehensive analysis of the dataset characteristics
